<h1>Research - A Sentiment Analysis Model of Hotel Reviews in Bengali Texts Based on Deep Learning techniques.</h1>

<h3> Project Summary</h3>

<p>
This project involves reviewing sentiment classification research and developing a machine learning
model for sentiment analysis of hotel reviews in Bangla. We intend to use an English-language Kaggle
dataset and translate it into Bangla. Text preprocessing, feature selection, and machine learning
classification are project methodologies in the sentiment analysis model. We'll use various natural
language processing (NLP) techniques to preprocess the data, extract necessary features such as word
frequency, TF-IDF, and so on, and then experiment with and compare the results using various machine
learning models.
